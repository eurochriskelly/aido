Shell LM
========

Introduction
------------

Shell LM is a command-line tool that helps you find the right command to run based on a natural language description of what you want to do. It uses a language model to generate suggestions and presents them in an interactive menu for you to choose from.

Installation
------------

To install Shell LM, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. Then, you can use npm to install the package globally:
```
npm install -g shell-lm
```
Usage
-----

To use Shell LM, simply run the `shell-lm` (or `shllm`) command followed by a natural language description of what you want to do:
```lua
$ shel-lm "Get a list of kubernetes pods"
Which command should I run?
1. kubectl get pods
2. kubectl get services
3. kubectl describe pods
Choose option:
```
Shell LM will present you with a list of suggested commands to run, and you can choose the one that best fits your needs.

Customization
-------------

Shell LM uses a language model to generate suggestions, which means that it can be customized to work with different domains and use cases. To customize the language model, you'll need to provide a training dataset of natural language descriptions and corresponding commands.
