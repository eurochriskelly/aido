# Johnny-McGory: Unleash Creative Writing

## INT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

A cozy living room bathed in the soft glow of a night lamp. A YOUNG CHILD, eyes
wide with anticipation, sits up in bed. Across, a PARENT, with a twinkle in
their eye, holds a laptop branded with the logo "Johnny-McGory".

### CHILD
(at a time way past their bedtime) You never told me a story :(

### PARENT
I have time for one quick story. Do you promise to sleep then?

### CHILD
I pwomise

### PARENT
(smiling) Will I tell you the story of Johnny McGory?

### CHILD
(excitedly) Yes, please!

### PARENT
Will I begin it?

### CHILD
Oh, please do!

### PARENT
That's all that's in it!

### CHILD
(laughing)
Tell me a real story.

### PARENT
A promise is a promise. Get to sleep!
